# Batch Renaming Utility
As the name suggests this is a terminal based (no GUI) bulk renaming utility written entirely in C++. I did this mainly because Windows/MAC operating systems have excellent softwares for bulk renaming, however when it comes to linux, a robust utility is not available. Hence I decided to code up my own !

This software already has a great number of features available, however I have plans to add many more.

## Features
* Ability to display the current working directory
* Ability to change the working directory
* Batch/Bulk renaming
* Crop name in bulk
* Join a string to the name in bulk
* Give serial indexing
* Remove serial indexing
* User friendly with responsive output

## How to use
Make sure you have a C/C++ environment setup in you system.

Even though you can change the working directory, still it is recommended to put the batch.cpp file in the directory you want to rename.Then open up a terminal and execute the following commands:
```
g++ batch.cpp
./a.out
```
